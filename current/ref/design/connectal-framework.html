<span id="sec-framework"></span><h1>The Connectal Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#the-connectal-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In and of themselves, none of the HW/SW interfaces considered in
Section <a class="reference internal" href="string-search.html#sec-strstr"><em>Accelerating String Search</em></a> are particularly complex.  On the other hand,
implementing the complete set and maintaining correctness as the
application evolves is a considerable amount of care, requiring deep
understanding of both the application and the platform.  The Connectal
framework is a collection of tools and library components which was
designed to address these challenges with the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Easy declaration and invocation of remote methods between
application components running on the host or in the FPGA.</li>
<li>Direct user-mode access to hardware accelerators from software.</li>
<li>High performance read and write bus master access to system
memory from the FPGA</li>
<li>Infrastructure for sharing full speed memory port access between
an arbitrary number of clients in the FPGA fabric</li>
<li>Portability across platforms using different CPUs, buses,
operating systems, and FPGAs</li>
<li>Fully integrated tool-chain support for dependency builds and
device configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we introduce the Connectal framework through a
discussion of its prominent features.</p>
<div class="section" id="portals">
<h2>Portals<a class="headerlink" href="#portals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Connectal implements remote method invocation between application
components using asynchronous messaging. The message and channel types
are application specific, requiring the user to define the HW/SW
interface using BSV interfaces as the interface definition language
(IDL).  These interfaces declare logical groups of unidirectional
<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">``</span></a>send&#8217;&#8217; methods, each of which is implemented as a FIFO channel by
the Connectal interface compiler; all channels corresponding to a
single BSV interface are grouped together into a single
<em>portal</em>.</p>
<p>From the interface specification, the Connectal interface compiler
generates code for marshalling the arguments of a method into a
message to be sent and unmarshaling values from a received
message. It generates a textit{proxy} to be invoked on the sending
side and a textit{wrapper} that invokes the appropriate method on the
receiving side.  Platform specific libraries are used to connect the
proxies and wrappers to the communication fabric.</p>
<p>In the hardware, each portal is assigned a disjoint address range.  On
the host, Connectal assigns each portal a unique Linux device
(/dev/portal*n*$) which is accessed by the application
software using the generated wrappers and proxies.  An application can
partition methods across several portals, to control access to the
interfaces by specific hardware or software modules.  To support
bi-directional communication, at least two portals are required: one
which allows software to <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">``</span></a>invoke&#8217;&#8217; hardware, and another for hardware
to <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">``</span></a>invoke&#8217;&#8217; software.  Each portal may be accessed by different
threads, processes, or directly from the kernel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="direct-user-mode-access-to-hardware">
<h2>Direct user-mode access to hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-user-mode-access-to-hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We designed Connectal to provide direct access to accelerators from
user-mode programs in order to eliminate the need for device-drivers
specific to each accelerator.  We have implemented a kernel module for
both X86 and ARM architectures with a minimal set of functionality:
the driver implements textbf{mmap} to map hardware registers into
user space and textbf{poll} to enable applications to suspend a thread waiting for
interrupts originating from the hardware accelerators.  These two
pieces of functionality have been defined to be completely generic; no
modification is required to kernel drivers as the HW/SW interface
evolves.  All knowledge of the interface register semantics (and
corresponding changes) is encoded by the interface compiler in the
generated proxies and wrappers which are compiled as part of the
application and executed in user-mode.</p>
<p>This approach is known as user-space device
drivers~cite{Khalidi:1995:EZI:974947,UIO:Howto} and has a number of
distinct advantages over traditional kernel modules.  To begin with,
it reduces the number of components that need to be modified if the
HW/SW interface changes, and eliminates the need for device-driver
development expertise in many cases.  Secondly, after the hardware
registers have been mapped into user address space, the need for
software to switch between user and kernel mode is all but eliminated
since all <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">``</span></a>driver&#8217;&#8217; functionality is being executed in user-space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shared-access-to-host-memory">
<h2>Shared Access to Host Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-access-to-host-memory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Connectal generates a hardware FIFO corresponding to each method in
the portal interface, and the software reads and writes these FIFOs
under certain conditions. To improve throughput, Connectal libraries
also support credit-based flow-control. Though credit-based
flow-control with interrupts is more efficient than polling status
registers from software, there is often the need for much higher
bandwidth communication between the hardware and software.</p>
<p>Hardware accelerators often communicate with the application through
direct access to shared memory. An important feature of Connectal is a
flexible, high performance API for allocating and sharing such memory,
and support for reading and writing this memory from hardware and
software. The Connectal framework implements this through the
combination of a Linux kernel driver, C++ libraries, and BSV modules
for the FPGA.  We implemented a custom kernel memory allocator for
Connectal, textbf{portalmem}, using the kernel dmabuf support.  Any
solution which allocates and shares memory between hardware and
software must meet two high-level requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Allocated buffers must have reference counts to prevent memory</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">leaks.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Efficient mechanisms must be provided to share the location of</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">allocated regions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the portalmem driver, programs can allocate regions of system
memory (DRAM) and map it into their own virtual address space.
Reference-counted access to shared memory regions allocated using
portalmem can be granted to other SW processes by transmitting the
file descriptor for the allocated region.
Reference counting has been implemented in the driver so that
once an allocated memory region has been dereferenced by all SW and HW
processes, it will be deallocated and returned to the kernel free
memory pool.</p>
<p>Simple hardware accelerators often require contiguous physical
addresses.  Unfortunately, when allocating memory from a shared pool
in a running system, obtaining large areas of contiguous
memory is often problematic, limiting the size of the region that can
be allocated. To support indexed access to non-contiguous memory
aggregates, Connectal provides address translation support to hardware
accelerators in the FPGA, similar to the MMU functionality on the CPU
side.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distributed-access-to-memory-ports">
<span id="sec-memreadengine"></span><h2>Distributed Access to Memory Ports<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-access-to-memory-ports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When building accelerators for an algorithm, multiple parameters are
often accessed directly from system memory using DMA. As the hardware
implementation is parallelized, multiple accesses to each parameter
may be required.  In these cases, the number of memory clients in the
application hardware usually exceeds the number of host memory ports.
Sharing these ports requires substantial effort, and scaling up a
memory interconnect while maximizing throughput and clock speed is
extremely challenging.</p>
<p>To support this common design pattern, the Connectal framework
provides provides a portable, scalable, high performance library that
applications can use to to facilitate the efficient sharing of host
memory ports.  This library is implemented as parameterized Bluespec
modules which allow the user to easily configure high-performance
memory access trees, supporting both reading and writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="platform-portability">
<h2>Platform Portability<a class="headerlink" href="#platform-portability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We structured Connectal to improve the portability of applications
across CPU types, operating systems, FPGAs, and how the CPU and FPGA
are connected.  The software and hardware libraries are largely
platform independent.  As a result, applications implemented in the
framework can be compiled to run on the range of different platforms.</p>
<p>Supported platforms are shown in Figure <em class="xref std std-ref">Fig-platforms</em>.
Application software can be executed on x86 and ARM CPUs running
either Ubuntu or Android operating systems. A range of different
Xilinx FPGAs can be connected to the CPU and system memory via PCI
Express or AXI. The BSV simulator (Bluesim) can be used in place of
actual FPGA hardware for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>When the target application needs to interact with other Linux kernel
resources (for example, a block device or a network interface), the
application may run in kernel mode with the logic run either in an
FPGA or in Bluesim.</p>
